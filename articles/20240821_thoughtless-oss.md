### The Thoughtless OSS Always Dies: A Cautionary Tale for Startup CEOs

## TL;DR

Recent changes in CockroachDB's licensing highlight the dangers of neglecting a sustainable business model in open-source software (OSS). For startup CEOs, it's crucial to plan for monetization, engage with the community, and strike a balance between open-source and proprietary offerings to ensure long-term success. Thoughtlessness in OSS can lead to failure, while a well-considered approach can foster thriving innovation and growth.

### Introduction

The open-source software (OSS) movement has fundamentally transformed the technology landscape. It has democratized access to powerful tools and frameworks, enabling startups and enterprises alike to build, innovate, and scale rapidly. However, the allure of open source is not without its challenges, especially for companies that depend on it for their business models. The recent licensing changes by Cockroach Labs, the company behind CockroachDB, serve as a stark reminder that open source success requires more than just a great product—it demands a thoughtful, sustainable approach to both community engagement and revenue generation.

For startup CEOs, this situation is particularly instructive. The balance between maintaining the open-source ethos and ensuring a viable business model is delicate and fraught with potential pitfalls. This article explores the CockroachDB licensing changes in detail, the risks of a thoughtless OSS strategy, and key lessons for startup leaders who wish to navigate the open-source landscape successfully.

### The CockroachDB Licensing Shift: What Happened?

CockroachDB has long been a darling of the open-source community, known for its resilience, scalability, and ease of use. However, Cockroach Labs recently announced significant changes to its licensing model, transitioning from an open-core model to a new enterprise license. This change primarily targets larger, well-funded companies that have been using CockroachDB's community edition without contributing back or paying for support.

The new licensing model essentially requires these larger enterprises to purchase a commercial license if they want to continue using CockroachDB, while smaller companies and individual developers can still use the community version for free. This move has sparked significant debate within the open-source community, with reactions ranging from understanding to outright criticism.

On one hand, this decision reflects the financial realities faced by Cockroach Labs. As the company has grown and its software has been adopted by larger enterprises, the need to generate revenue to sustain development and support has become more pressing. On the other hand, the change has raised concerns about the long-term viability of open source as a model, especially when companies are forced to make such shifts to ensure profitability.

### The Risks of a Thoughtless OSS Strategy

#### 1. Sustainability Issues

One of the most significant risks of an open-source project is sustainability. Many open-source projects begin with noble intentions: to democratize access to technology, foster collaboration, and drive innovation. However, the reality is that without a clear path to monetization, these projects can quickly become unsustainable. The initial excitement and community involvement might carry the project through its early stages, but as the software grows in complexity and its user base expands, the need for financial resources becomes critical.

In the case of CockroachDB, the initial open-core model allowed for broad adoption, but it also created a situation where many large companies were using the software without paying for it. This led to a scenario where the costs of maintaining and improving the software began to outstrip the revenue generated from commercial licenses. The result was a need to shift the licensing model to ensure that the company could continue to support the development of CockroachDB.

For startup CEOs, the lesson here is clear: a successful open-source project requires more than just great code. It requires a business model that can sustain the project over the long term. Without this, even the most promising open-source project can falter and die.

#### 2. Community Erosion

Open-source projects thrive on community involvement. The community is often the lifeblood of an open-source project, contributing code, documentation, bug reports, and more. However, if the project lacks a clear direction or fails to provide the right incentives for community involvement, this community can quickly dissipate. In some cases, a lack of clarity around the project's licensing or governance can lead to forks, where the community splinters into competing versions of the software.

The CockroachDB licensing change has the potential to create this kind of community erosion. While the new license may be necessary for financial sustainability, it could alienate some members of the community who feel that the project is moving away from its open-source roots. This could lead to a decline in community contributions and a loss of momentum for the project.

For startup CEOs, the key takeaway is that maintaining a strong, engaged community is essential for the success of any open-source project. This requires clear communication, transparency, and a commitment to the principles of open source, even as the project evolves.

#### 3. Market Misalignment

Startups that rely on or contribute to open-source projects must ensure that the project aligns with market demands. If the project fails to meet the needs of its users or pivots away from the market's requirements, it can quickly become irrelevant. This misalignment can lead to a loss of users, contributors, and, ultimately, revenue.

The CockroachDB licensing change was a response to a market misalignment: large companies were using the software without paying for it, which created a financial burden for Cockroach Labs. The new license aims to correct this misalignment by ensuring that those who derive significant value from the software contribute financially to its development.

For startup CEOs, the lesson is to continuously monitor the market and ensure that their open-source projects remain aligned with the needs of their users. This requires ongoing engagement with the community and a willingness to adapt the project's direction as necessary.

### Lessons for Startup CEOs

#### 1. Plan for Monetization Early

One of the key takeaways from the CockroachDB situation is the importance of having a clear monetization strategy from the outset. While it's tempting to focus solely on community building and adoption, ensuring a path to revenue is crucial for long-term sustainability. This doesn’t mean sacrificing the principles of open source, but rather finding a model that aligns with both the community’s needs and the company’s financial goals.

Startups can explore several monetization strategies, including dual licensing, offering premium features or services, or providing paid support and consulting. The key is to develop a strategy that is flexible and can evolve as the project grows and the market changes.

#### 2. Engage with the Community

Open-source projects are as much about the community as they are about the code. Engaging with your user base, understanding their needs, and being transparent about your roadmap and licensing can help build trust and avoid backlash when changes are necessary.

In the case of CockroachDB, the licensing change could have been better received if there had been more communication with the community beforehand. Startups should prioritize open dialogue with their users, soliciting feedback and addressing concerns proactively. This can help mitigate the negative impact of necessary but potentially controversial changes.

#### 3. Balance Open and Closed Models

Finding the right balance between open-source and proprietary offerings is critical. Some companies adopt a dual-licensing model, where the core functionality remains open-source, but additional features or enterprise-grade support require a commercial license. This approach can provide the best of both worlds, ensuring broad adoption while securing revenue from those who can afford to pay.

Cockroach Labs’ shift towards a more commercial license is an example of trying to find this balance. While it may not satisfy everyone, it’s a necessary step to ensure that the company can continue to support and develop the software at a high level.

#### 4. Adapt and Evolve

The software landscape is constantly changing, and open-source projects must evolve with it. This means being willing to adapt your licensing model, governance structure, and business strategy as the market and community dynamics shift. Being too rigid can lead to irrelevance, while thoughtful evolution can ensure long-term success.

The CockroachDB licensing change reflects a willingness to adapt to new realities. For startup CEOs, this underscores the importance of flexibility and the ability to pivot when necessary. Staying attuned to industry trends and being open to change can make the difference between a thriving project and one that fails.

### The Future of OSS: Thoughtfulness Is Key

The CockroachDB licensing change serves as a potent reminder that open-source is not a one-size-fits-all solution. For startup CEOs, the key takeaway is that a successful OSS strategy requires careful planning, community engagement, and a sustainable business model. Without these elements, even the most promising open-source project can falter. In the fast-paced world of startups, thoughtfulness in OSS is not just a nice-to-have—it's essential for survival.

**Conclusion**

As a startup CEO, your decisions around open-source can shape the trajectory of your company. While OSS offers unparalleled opportunities for innovation and growth, it also comes with significant challenges. By learning from the experiences of others, such as the recent developments with CockroachDB, you can craft a strategy that leverages the best of open-source while ensuring your company's long-term success. Remember, the thoughtless OSS always dies, but a well-considered approach can lead to thriving success.
